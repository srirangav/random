random [num1] [num2]
.SH DESCRIPTION
random is a simple utility for generating a random integer.

When run without any arguments, random prints out a random integer between
0 and ULONG_MAX.

When a single argument is provided, if that argument is a valid positive
integer below ULONG_MAX, random prints out a random integer between 0 and
the specified integer. If the argument is 0, random prints out a random
integer between 0 and ULONG_MAX.

If two or more arguments are provided, and the first two arguments are
valid positive integers below ULONG_MAX, random prints out a random
integer between the first two arguments.
